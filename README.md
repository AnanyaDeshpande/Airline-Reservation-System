# Airline-Reservation-System

## Introduction

#### Develop an Airline Reservation and Management System that facilitates the booking, management, and administration of airline flights. The system should provide passengers with a user-friendly experience, enabling them to search for flights, make reservations, manage bookings, and process payments. The system should handle flight scheduling, managing seat availability, processing payments, ticket generation, and booking confirmation.

#### State design pattern is suitable for this scenario as there is a ticket scenario. With respect to tickets, it can be in different states. For ex- Confirm, Abort, in process. Based on its status the behavior changes when ticket status changes.
